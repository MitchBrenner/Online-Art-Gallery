# Online-Art-Gallery

This assignment involves the implementation of an online art gallery using Binary Search Trees (BST). An art gallery is a place in which visual arts are displayed. It represents a meeting point for art lovers where one can explore and sometimes purchase artwork by emerging, established or master artists.
Our BST will store a set of visual artwork objects. Art lovers can visit and explore the art gallery and lookup for a specific artwork. They can also purchase a specific artwork. The lookup key information for the retrieval or search operation combines the year of creation of the artwork and its name.
